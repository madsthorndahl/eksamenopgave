Dating App: Exam winter 2020.

Started this coding on another Github repository, but was unable to push my work to that repository, as i started from scratch.
This was done, because i created a system that only depended on localstorage, and i needed it to depend on a server instead (rookie mistake). 
To see my first attempt at making this dating app (the one depending only on localstorage), i refer to my other github repository: Eksamensopgave2
The first push to this repository shows how i managed to implement a lot of the code from the first try, to make my HTTP request work, and get response from the server.
The following pushes to this repository will show my further work on the dating app depending on a server.
